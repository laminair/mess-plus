## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the sentence
The sentence is a quote from a German report, and it expresses regret over the parliament's hasty decision regarding guidelines.","As the rapporteur regrets, the parliament has jumped on the moving train in relation to the guidelines, since the negotiations with the states have already progressed so far that one cannot assume that this report will have immediate effects.","I share the regrets she expressed, namely that Parliament has become involved rather late in the day as regards these guidelines, since by now the procedure for negotiations with the states is so far advanced that I cannot see this report having any sort of immediate effect, which in my view is a pity."
"Deshalb halte ich es für notwendig, daß das Parlament vorausdenkt und die Leitlinien für die Revision nach der Hälfte der Laufzeit im Jahr 2003 festlegt und noch versuchen sollte, die zweite Programmphase ab 2003 zu beeinflussen.","Therefore, I think it is necessary that the parliament takes into account and the guidelines for the revision of the second phase of the program in 2003 set, and still try to influence the second phase of the program from 2003.","Since that, I think it is necessary for the Parliament to anticipate and set the guidelines for revision after half the term in 2003 and still try to influence the second phase of the program, which starts in 2003.","Therefore, I consider it necessary that the parliament anticipates and sets the guidelines for the revision after half of the period in the year 2003 and still tries to influence the second phase of the program from 2003 onwards.","Consequently, I feel we must look to the future and establish guidelines for the mid-term review in 2003, and thus have an influence on the second phase of programming set to follow 2003."
"Ich meine damit, daß wir uns am Anfang des Planungszeitraums 2000-2006 befinden, der angesichts von zwei großen Herausforderungen keineswegs als Routineangelegenheit aufgefaßt werden darf.","I mean that we are at the beginning of the planning period 2000-2006, which, in the face of two major challenges, should not be regarded as routine matters.","I mean that we are at the beginning of the planning period 2000-2006, which, given two major challenges, should not be treated as routine business.","I mean that we are at the beginning of the planning period 2000-2006, which, in view of two major challenges, should by no means be regarded as a routine matter.","In brief, I would like to say that we are entering the period when we are called upon to manage the programming for 2000-2006, which must be no routine period for the good reason that we have two major challenges to face."

The translation is: 

Mr.",Mr.,"Mr President, I too would like to congratulate the rapporteur on her excellent work."
Angesichts der Herausforderung der Globalisierung und der Osterweiterung bedarf Europa meines Erachtens in den nächsten Jahren für die Programmplanung und die Wiederankurbelung seiner Wirtschaft mehr denn je angemessener und exakter Vorgaben.,"Given the challenges of globalisation and the Osterweiterung, I believe that Europe needs in the coming years more than ever a more precise and accurate set of guidelines for its programme planning and reactivation of its economy.","In view of the challenges of globalization and the Eastern expansion, I believe in the coming years that Europe needs more than ever appropriate and exact specifications for its economic program planning and the revitalization of its economy.","Considering the challenge of globalization and enlargement, I believe that in the coming years Europe will need more than ever precise and adequate guidelines for programming and boosting its economy.","Over the coming years, faced with the challenges of globalisation and eastward enlargement, Europe will, more than ever before, require appropriate detailed guidance on how to plan and revitalise its economy."
In diesem Sinne müssen die Europäische Union als Ganzes und jeder Mitgliedstaat im besonderen von sämtlichen zu Gebote stehenden Mitteln und Möglichkeiten und damit auch von den vorhandenen Strukturfonds optimalen Gebrauch machen.,"In this sense, the European Union must be considered as a whole and every member state in particular from all of the above mentioned means and possibilities and thus also from the existing structural funds to optimal use.","In this sense, the European Union as a whole and each member state in particular must make optimal use of all available means and opportunities, and also of the existing structural funds.","In this sense, the European Union as a whole and each member state in particular must make optimal use of all available means and possibilities, and therefore also of the existing structural funds.","To this end, Europe as a whole, and each Member State individually, will have to make optimum use of all available resources and capacities, including the Structural Funds."
"Erforderlich dazu ist, daß die Europäische Kommission über die guten Vorsätze hinaus ihren Leitlinien mehr Transparenz verleiht und sich ganz gezielt um die Kontrolle der Verwendung dieser Mittel durch die Mitgliedstaaten bemüht.",The necessary thing is that the European Commission is given more transparency by giving more guidelines to the good intentions and trying to control the use of these funds by the member states specifically.,"To this end, the European Commission is required to go beyond good intentions by giving its guidelines more transparency and to make a concerted effort to control the use of these funds by the member states.","To achieve this, the European Commission must go beyond good intentions and give its guidelines more transparency and specifically strive for control over the use of these funds by the member states.","For this to be possible, what we need from the European Commission are not just good intentions, but clearer guidelines and a firm commitment to monitoring the way these resources are used by the Member States."
"In Italien beispielsweise gab es in den letzten Jahren Probleme bei der Inanspruchnahme der Strukturfonds, wobei die Hauptgründe in einer aufgeblähten Bürokratie, in unzulänglichen Informationen sowie darin lagen, daß die Wirtschafts- und Sozialakteure auf lokaler Ebene zu wenig beteiligt wurden.","In Italy, for example, there were problems in the last years with the use of the structural funds, where the main reasons were a bloated bureaucracy, insufficient information, and the fact that the economic and social actors on local level were not sufficiently involved","In Italy, for example, there were problems in the last few years with the use of structural funds, where the main reasons were an over-extended bureaucracy, inadequate information, and the fact that economic and social actors on the local level were not sufficiently","In Italy, for example, there have been problems with the Structural Funds in recent years, where the main reasons were an inflated bureaucracy, insufficient information, and the fact that economic and social actors on the local level were not sufficiently involved.","For example, in recent years Italy has had problems in utilising the Structural Funds, mainly because of excessive bureaucracy, insufficient information and a lack of involvement of economic and social operators at local level."
"Ich möchte daher die Kommission auf zwei Punkte hinweisen: Erstens muß die Konzertierung als Instrument der Koordinierung und der Beteiligung sämtlicher lokaler und regionaler Marktteilnehmer an den Entscheidungen optimal genutzt werden, um speziell Ungleichgewichte und Ungleichheiten zu vermeiden; zweitens bedarf es einer Vereinfachung und transparenteren Gestaltung der Verwaltungsprozesse, die sich allzu häufig unnötig in die Länge ziehen und derart kompliziert sind, daß sie, was vor allem von den europäischen KMU beanstandet wird, ein Hindernis für den Zugang zu den Fonds darstellen.","I therefore recommend the Commission to use two points: Firstly, the consolidation should be used as an instrument of coordination and participation of all local and regional market participants in the decisions, in order to prevent specifically unequal and unequal distributions; secondly, it should","I therefore point out to the Commission on two points: Firstly, the concertation must be optimally utilized as an instrument of coordination and participation of all local and regional market participants in the decisions, in order to avoid specifically imbalances and inequalities; second","I would therefore like to draw the Commission's attention to two points: Firstly, the concertation as an instrument of coordination and participation of all local and regional market players in the decisions must be optimally used in order to avoid especially imbalances and inequalities","Firstly, we need to make the best possible use of consultation as a means of ensuring proper coordination and participation by all local and regional operators in decision-making, precisely so that imbalances and inequalities can be avoided. Secondly, a genuine effort is required to make administrative procedures simpler and more transparent, since, they are all too often unnecessarily lengthy and complicated, to the point of hindering access to the Funds."
"Abschließend halte ich es für ziemlich gravierend, daß den territorialen Beschäftigungspakten und vor allem den Modalitäten zur Bekämpfung der Frauen- und Jugendarbeitslosigkeit in der Mitteilung der Kommission wenig Beachtung geschenkt worden ist.","Endlich halte ich es für ziemlich gravierend, dass die territorialen Beschäftigungspakete und vor allem die Modalitäten zur Bekämpfung der Frauen- und Jugendarbeitslosigkeit in der Mitteilung","""Finally, I think it is quite serious that the territorial employment agreements and, above all, the modalities for combating female and youth unemployment in the Commission's report have been given little attention.","Finally, I consider it quite serious that the territorial employment pacts and, above all, the modalities for combating youth and female unemployment have been largely overlooked in the Commission's communication.","I will conclude, Mr President, by saying that the failure of the Commission' s communication to focus on territorial pacts and, especially, methods of combating unemployment among women and young people, is cause for serious concern."
"Herr Präsident, mir ist es ebenso wie meinem Kollegen Herrn Evans eine besondere Freude, erstmals in diesem Haus zu diesem sehr wichtigen Problem das Wort zu ergreifen, zumal ich mit den West Midlands einen Teil des Vereinigten Königreichs vertrete, der bisher in den Genuß von Ziel-2-Fördermitteln gekommen ist.",Mr.,"Mr President, it is equally my pleasure to be the first person to address this very important issue in this house, particularly as I represent the West Midlands part of the United Kingdom, which has so far benefited from the Goal 2 funding.",Mr.,"Mr President, like my colleague Mr Evans, it is a particular pleasure to rise and make my first speech to this House on this very important issue, especially since I represent a part of the United Kingdom, the West Midlands, which has hitherto benefited from Objective 2 funding in particular."
"Doch der dem Haus heute vorliegende Bericht ist ein klassisches Beispiel dafür, daß wir, wenn wir nicht aufpassen, Ideen entwickeln, die zwar phantastisch klingen, für die Bürger, die direkt von ihnen profitieren sollen, jedoch u. U. von wenig Belang sind.","But the report of the house today is a classic example of that, that when we do not pay attention, ideas that seem to be fantastic, yet that profit the citizens directly, who are affected by them, are in fact of little importance.","But the report that is currently relevant to the house is a classic example of the fact that if we do not pay attention, ideas are developed that, although they sound fantastically, are of little importance to the citizens who are supposed to benefit from them","But the report currently available to the house is a classic example of how we, if we do not watch out, develop ideas that sound fantastic, but are of little importance to the citizens who are supposed to benefit directly from them.","But the report before the House tonight is a prime example of how, if we are not very careful, we can produce very grandiose-sounding ideas that lack the substance to make them relevant to the people who benefit directly from them."
"Der Bericht selbst verfolgt eine gute Absicht, es fehlt ihm jedoch wie vielen unserer Aktivitäten auf diesem Gebiet an einer klaren Zielsetzung und einer soliden Grundlage für seine Umsetzung in die Praxis.","The report itself follows a good intention, however, he lacks many of our activities in this field with a clear goal and a solid foundation for its implementation into practice.","The report itself has a good intention, but it lacks a clear goal and a solid basis for its implementation in practice.","The report itself has a good intention, but it lacks a clear objective and a solid foundation for its implementation in practice, like many of our activities in this field.","The report itself is well-intentioned but, as so often when we deal with these issues, lacks clarity of purpose and a sound basis for operability."
"Deshalb schlagen meine Fraktion und ich drei wichtige Änderungen und Zusätze vor, mit denen wir den Vorschlag in keiner Weise verwässern, sondern mit denen wir seine Relevanz für diejenigen, denen er als Anleitung dienen soll, erhöhen wollen.","So schlagen wir drei wichtige Änderungen und Zusätze vor, mit denen wir den Vorschlag nicht verwässern, sondern die Relevanz für diejenigen, die er als Anleitung dienen soll, erhöhen","Therefore, my faction and I propose three important changes and additions that will in no way dilute the proposal, but rather increase the relevance of the proposal for those who are to use it as a guide.","Therefore, my group and I suggest three important amendments and additions which in no way dilute the proposal, but which we want to increase its relevance for those to whom it is intended as a guide.","That is why I and my Group are proposing three key amendments and additions to the text, not to take anything away from the proposal, but to make it more relevant to those whom it is there to guide."

"Frau Schroedter, Sie haben zu Recht daran erinnert, daß es im wesentlichen Aufgabe der Mitgliedstaaten und der Regionen ist, ihre eigenen Entwicklungsprioritäten festzulegen. Doch aufgrund der Kofinanzierung der Programme durch die Europäische Union ist es notwendig und richtig, daß auch gemeinschaftliche Prioritäten berücksichtigt werden, wie sie hier diskutiert und verabschiedet werden, um diese gemeinschaftliche Dimension des wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalts zu fördern, an die viele von Ihnen mit Nachdruck erinnert haben.","Frau Schroedter, you are right to remind us that it is in the main responsibility of member states and regions to establish their own development priorities.","The translation is:

"Ich kann jetzt nicht alle nennen: Einführung von sektorübergreifenden Maßnahmen, effizientere Nutzung öffentlicher Gelder, Unterstützung der unterschiedlichen Partner bei der gemeinsamen Entwicklung von regionalen oder nationalen Programmen usw.

"Herr Präsident, Herr Kommissar, sehr geehrte Kollegen! Bis heute ist es in der Regionalpolitik der Europäischen Gemeinschaft nicht gelungen, die bestehenden Unterschiede bei der Pro-Kopf-Leistung signifikant zum Ausdruck zum bringen.","Mr President, Mr Chairman, dear colleagues! As of today, it has not been possible for the European Community to bring the existing differences in the Pro-Kopf-Performance to the point where they can be expressed.",Mr.,"Mr President, Mr Commissioner, esteemed colleagues!

"Die Lage ist ernst, denn es gibt heute sogar in der Europäischen Union einen offensichtlichen Zusammenhang zwischen Arbeitslosigkeit und Armut, wie die äußerst besorgniserregende Tatsache beweist, daß die Arbeitslosigkeit in den von diesem Problem am stärksten betroffenen Regionen durchschnittlich 23,7 % erreicht, und diese Regionen decken sich mit Armutsgebieten, während in den 25 Regionen mit geringerer Arbeitslosigkeit, die den wohlhabenden Gebieten entsprechen, die Arbeitslosigkeit nur bei 4 % liegt.","The situation is serious, because today there is even in the European Union an obvious connection between unemployment and poverty, as a very alarming fact demonstrates, that unemployment in the regions most affected by this problem, on average, reaches 23.","The situation is serious, because there is even today a clear connection between unemployment and poverty in the European Union, as the extremely alarming fact shows that unemployment in the most affected regions averages 23.","The situation is serious, because there is today even in the European Union an obvious connection between unemployment and poverty, as the extremely alarming fact proves, that the unemployment rate in the most affected regions is an average of 23.","We have a serious situation in which in the European Union today, there is a genuine link between unemployment and poverty, as demonstrated by the very worrying fact that unemployment has reached, on average, 23.7% in the regions worst affected, regions which also happen to be poor areas, whilst in the 25 regions with the lowest unemployment, corresponding to the richer areas, unemployment stands at just 4%."
"Angesichts dieser Situation muß aus dem Bericht, den das Parlament annimmt, klar hervorgehen, daß Maßnahmen notwendig sind, die eindeutig auf die Bekämpfung der relativen Armut und der Arbeitslosigkeit gerichtet sind. Maßnahmen wie die für diese Zwecke angemessene Verwendung der Strukturfonds, die häufig unsachgemäß eingesetzt werden, und zwar mit zentralen staatlichen Politiken, die Modernisierung der Bereiche Telekommunikation und Kommunikation, indem man vor allem die am wenigsten entwickelten Regionen bis voraussichtlich 2007 in die transeuropäischen Eisenbahnnetze einbindet, die Berücksichtigung und Entwicklung der Agrar- und Fischereiressourcen und -kapazitäten dieser Länder, die oft gerade von den Politiken einer gleichgültigen Europäischen Union benachteiligt werden, die Förderung aktiver beschäftigungspolitischer Konzepte, hauptsächlich für Frauen und Jugendliche.",A situation like this demands that clear action be taken from the report that the parliament is about to adopt.,"**Regarding this situation, it must clearly emerge from the report that the Parliament accepts that measures are needed that are clearly directed at combating poverty and unemployment.","In the face of this situation, it must be clearly apparent from the report that the Parliament accepts that measures are necessary that are clearly aimed at combating relative poverty and unemployment.","Given this situation, the report approved by Parliament must highlight the need for measures that aim unequivocally to fight relative poverty and unemployment: measures such as the appropriate use of structural funds for these purposes, which are often misspent, with centralised state policies and the modernisation of telecommunication and communication systems, with the particular aim of integrating the least developed regions into the Trans-European rail Networks, which are due in 2007."
"Nur mit der konsequenten Durchführung solcher Maßnahmen wird es möglich sein, ein soziales und regionales Ungleichgewicht zu überwinden, das nicht das historische Ergebnis unabwendbarer Schwächen, sondern von Ausgrenzung und Wirtschaftspolitiken mit negativen Auswirkungen ist.","Only through the consistent implementation of these measures will it be possible to overcome a social and regional imbalance that is not a fixed result of irreversible weaknesses, but of exclusion and negative economic policies.","Only with the consistent implementation of such measures will it be possible to overcome a social and regional imbalance that is not the result of inevitable weaknesses, but of exclusion and policies with negative effects.","Only with the consistent implementation of such measures will it be possible to overcome a social and regional imbalance that is not the historical result of unavoidable weaknesses, but of exclusion and policies with negative effects.","There should also be measures that respect and develop the resources and capabilities of these countries' agriculture and fisheries, which are often harmed by the European Union' s own insensitive policies, as well as the promotion of active policies to create jobs, particularly for women and young people. Only through the decisive application of this kind of measure will we be able to overcome social and regional inequality, which is not the historical product of inherent defects but of marginalisation and economic policies which have had harmful effects."

Der vorliegende Bericht des Kollegen Berend folgt genau der von der Europäischen Kommission bestimmten Strategie, indem die Frage der Steigerung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit absolut in den Vordergrund gerückt wird.",Mr.,Mr.,Mr.,"Mr President, Commissioner, Mr Berend' s report is precisely in line with the strategy determined by the European Commission inasmuch as the question of increasing competitiveness is brought right to the fore."

I would also ask that a great deal more emphasis be placed on these points in the seventh periodic report.
"Das bedeutet nicht, daß ich nicht die Notwendigkeit von Wettbewerbsstärke sehe, um so mehr, als ich selbst Unternehmer in einem Ziel 1-Gebiet bin, und zwar in Brandenburg in der Bundesrepublik Deutschland, und sehr wohl die Sorgen und Nöte von klein- und mittelständischen Unternehmen kenne.","This means that I do not see the necessity of competitiveness in order to be more than I am as an entrepreneur in a region of 1 target area, namely in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and also the concerns and problems of small","This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness to achieve more, as I myself am an entrepreneur in a target area 1 region, namely in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and I am well aware of the concerns","That does not mean that I do not see the necessity of competitiveness, the more so as I myself am an entrepreneur in a goal 1 area, namely in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am well aware of the worries and troubles","This does not mean that I do not see the need for competitiveness, particularly as I myself am an entrepreneur in an Objective 1 Region, that is in Brandenburg in the Federal Republic of Germany, and am only too aware of the problems and concerns of small and medium-sized enterprises."

Sie werden durch geeignete Aktivitäten aus den Strukturfonds der Europäischen Union unterstützt.,They will be supported by appropriate activities from the European Union structural funds.,"**[Insert translation here]**_

(Note: I'll provide the translation in the next response) 

**Response:**

The translation of the given sentence from German to English is:

They will be supported by appropriate activities from the structural funds of the European",They are supported by appropriate activities from the Structural Funds of the European Union.,They are supported by appropriate European Union structural fund activities.
"Allein die Unterstützung der Wettbewerbsfähigkeit von Unternehmen kann die anvisierte Kohäsion zwischen wirtschaftlicher und sozialer Entwicklung niemals kompensieren, weil einfach die Grundlagen für einen selbsttragenden Aufschwung in diesen Ziel 1-Regionen fehlen.",Alone the support of the competitiveness of companies can never compensate the desired cohesion between economic and social development because the basic foundations for a self-sustaining growth in these target regions are lacking.,"Only the support of the competitiveness of companies can never compensate for the desired cohesion between economic and social development, because simply the foundations for a self-sustaining growth in these Goal 1 regions are lacking.","Alone, the support of the competitiveness of companies can never compensate for the intended cohesion between economic and social development, because simply the foundations for a self-sustaining upswing in these Target 1 regions are lacking.","Supporting only the competitiveness of companies will never be able to compensate for the envisaged cohesion between economic and social development, simply because there is no basis for a self-supporting upturn in these Objective 1 Regions."
"Und die Erfahrung, daß wirtschaftliche Entwicklung allein nicht dazu beiträgt, Arbeitslosigkeit abzubauen, untermauert doch die Tatsache, daß man mindestens 3 % Steigerung des Bruttosozialprodukts benötigt, um überhaupt zusätzliche Arbeitsplätze zu schaffen.","And the experience that economic development alone does not contribute to reducing unemployment, supports, however, the fact that at least 3 % increase in the Gross National Product is needed, in order to create additional jobs.","And the experience that economic development alone does not contribute to reducing unemployment, actually underscores the fact that at least a 3% increase in Gross Domestic Product is needed to create additional jobs.","And the experience that economic development alone does not contribute to reducing unemployment, actually reinforces the fact that at least 3% increase in GDP is needed to create additional jobs at all.","After all, the knowledge that economic development alone does not help to combat unemployment substantiates the fact than an increase of at least 3% in gross domestic product is needed to create any additional jobs at all."
"Die ausschließliche Konzentration auf nachfrageorientierte, angebotsorientierte Wirtschaftpolitik kann so nicht funktionieren.",The exclusive concentration of demand-oriented and supply-oriented economic policy cannot function.,"The exclusive concentration on demand-oriented, supply-oriented economic policy cannot function.",This cannot work by exclusively concentrating on demand-oriented and supply-oriented economic policy.,Concentrating to the exclusion of all else on supply and demand-orientated economic policy is not the answer.
"Und wenn man die schon betreibt, muß man größtenteils Erweiterungsinvestitionen tätigen und weniger Rationalisierungsinvestitionen.","And when it is already in operation, one must do most of the expansion investment and less of the rationalization investment.","And if you already run it, you must make mostly expansion investments and less rationalization investments.","And if you are already doing it, you have to make mostly expansion investments and fewer rationalization investments.","And those that do pursue such a policy must invest in expansion for the most part and, to a lesser extent, in rationalisation."
"Man muß das unbedingt koppeln mit einer nachfrageorientierten Wirtschaftspolitik, damit wir überhaupt die Chance haben, die soziale Situation in diesen Gebieten zu verbessern.","One must therefore link the unattainable with a demand-oriented economic policy, in order to have the chance to improve the social situation in these areas.","We must definitely link this to a demand-oriented economic policy, so that we have any chance of improving the social situation in these regions.","We have to couple this with a demand-oriented economic policy, so we even have a chance to improve the social situation in these areas.",It is imperative for this to go hand in hand with a demand-orientated economic policy if we are to have any chance at all of improving the social situation in these areas.
"In den Regionen sind diese Situationen sehr, sehr unterschiedlich.","In the regions, these situations are very, very different.",The situation is very different in each region.,"In these regions, the situation is very, very different.",The situation varies to an enormous degree throughout the regions.
"Das heißt, es bedarf eben auch einer Menge begleitender Maßnahmen, um dort überhaupt etwas machen zu können.","It means, that it is also necessary to have a lot of additional measures in place to be able to do anything there.",This means that there also needs to be a lot of accompanying measures in order to be able to do anything at all.,That means that a lot of accompanying measures are also needed to be able to do anything at all there.,"In other words, what is needed is a number of accompanying measures if anything at all is to be accomplished there."
"Das wären zum Beispiel Maßnahmen zur beruflichen Ausbildung, zur Weiterbildung, zur Wiedereingliederung von Menschen, die bereits aus dem Produktionsprozeß vertrieben worden sind, zur flexiblen Gestaltung von Arbeitszeit und Arbeitszeitformen, um persönliche und soziale Aspekte entschieden besser in Einklang bringen zu können und vielleicht auch die Erwerbstätigkeit von Frauen wieder zu fördern.","The above mentioned measures could be for example measures for professional training, further training, to reintegration of people who have already been removed from the production process, to flexible design of working time and working time forms, to better integrate personal and social aspects in","This would be for example measures for vocational training, further education, reintegration of people who have already been expelled from the production process, flexible design of working time and working time forms, to be able to better align personal and social aspects and maybe also","For example, this would be measures for vocational training, further education, reintegration of people who have already been driven out of the production process, flexible shaping of working hours and working time forms to bring personal and social aspects into harmony more decisively and","For example, these would be measures for vocational training, for further education, for re-integrating people who have already been excluded from the production process, for the flexibilisation of working time and working time arrangements, in order to bring about a definite improvement in the integration of personal and social aspects and perhaps also to promote employment opportunities for women again."
"Herr Präsident, mein Kompliment an den Berichterstatter für seinen detaillierten Bericht.",Mr.,"?
 
The translation is: 

Mr.",Mr.,"Mr President, my compliments to the rapporteur for his in-depth report."
Mit den Strukturfonds soll im wesentlichen die wirtschaftliche und soziale Kohäsion zwischen den Regionen der Europäischen Union verbessert werden.,"With the structural funds, in principle the economic and social cohesion between the regions of the European Union will be improved.","With the structural funds, basically the economic and social cohesion between the regions of the European Union will be improved.",The main aim of the structural funds is to improve the economic and social cohesion between the regions of the European Union.,The key goal of the structural funds is to strengthen social and economic cohesion between the regions within the European Union.
Mit Hilfe von Investitionsanreizen verschiedenster Art bemüht sich die Europäische Union um eine Steigerung des BIP pro Kopf sowie um Beschäftigungswachstum.,With the help of investment incentives of various kinds the European Union strives to increase GDP per capita as well as employment growth.,"With the help of investment incentives of different kinds, the European Union is trying to increase the GDP per capita as well as to boost employment growth.",The European Union is endeavouring to increase GDP per capita and employment growth through the use of investment incentives of all kinds.,"By stimulating a diversity of investments, the European Union is endeavouring to increase the GDP per capita and to boost employment."
"Aus dem sechsten Periodischen Bericht über die Regionen kann man vorsichtig schlußfolgern, daß diese Anreize recht oft nicht den gewünschten Erfolg zeitigen.","From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can cautiously conclude that these incentives are often not to achieve the desired result.","**From the sixth Periodic Report on the Regions, one can cautiously infer that these incentives often do not result in the desired success.","From the Sixth Periodic Report on the Regions, one can cautiously infer that these incentives often do not achieve the desired success.","From the sixth periodic report on the regions, one can draw the hesitant conclusion that these incentives do not always have the desired effect."
"Die auf die Steigerung des Pro-Kopf-BIP in den Ziel-1-Regionen ausgerichteten Bemühungen führen nicht immer zu diesem Wachstum. Nicht eben ein befriedigendes Ergebnis in einer Zeit, die, vor allem in den letzten Jahren, von wirtschaftlichem Aufschwung geprägt war.",The efforts aimed at increasing the per capita Gross Domestic Product in the target 1 regions do not always lead to this growth.,The efforts aimed at increasing the per capita GDP in the Goal-1 regions are not always leading to this growth.,The efforts aimed at increasing per capita GDP in the target 1 regions do not always lead to this growth.,"The efforts made in order to drive up the GDP per capita in Objective 1 regions do not always result in such an increase, not really a satisfying result over a period during which, certainly over the past couple of years, there has been economic growth."
"Wie der Berichterstatter ausführt, ist außerdem eine Beschäftigungswirkung der Strukturmaßnahmen kaum zu spüren.","As the reporter explains, the impact of structural measures is hardly perceivable.","''As the reporter explains, the employment effect of the structural measures is barely perceptible.","As the rapporteur points out, there is also hardly any employment effect from the structural measures.","As indicated by the rapporteur, the effects of the structural measures, on the other hand, are minimal as far as employment is concerned."
"Deshalb halte ich es für angezeigt, bei der Bewertung der Effizienz gemeinschaftlicher Beihilfen Zurückhaltung zu üben.",I think it's worth considering a slower pace when evaluating the efficiency of collective aid programs.,I therefore consider it appropriate to exercise restraint when evaluating the efficiency of joint aids.,"Therefore, I believe it is advisable to exercise restraint in evaluating the efficiency of collective aid.",Some reservation about the effectiveness of Community aid is therefore called for.
"Auch die Feststellung, daß die Unterschiede zwischen den Regionen in den Mitgliedstaaten sich mitunter sogar verschärfen, wirft ernste Fragen auf.","Also the finding that the differences between the regions in the member states often even intensify, raises serious questions.","Also the establishment that the differences between the regions in the member states sometimes even sharpen, raises serious questions.","Also, the fact that the differences between the regions in the member states sometimes even sharpen, raises serious questions.","Also, the observation that the disparities between regions within Member States sometimes even become more pronounced raises serious questions."
"Mir erscheint es deshalb sinnvoll und notwendig, unsere Aufmerksamkeit, eben wenn es um Beschäftigungsanreize geht, sowohl auf die nationalen als auch auf die regionalen Behörden zu richten.","Mir erscheint es sinnvoll und notwendig, unsere Aufmerksamkeit sowohl auf die nationalen als auch auf die regionalen Behörden zu richten.","It seems to me therefore sensible and necessary, that our attention, even when it comes to employment incentives, should be directed both at national and regional authorities.","Therefore, it seems to me to be sensible and necessary to direct our attention, when it comes to employment incentives, both to national and regional authorities.","Mr President, it therefore seems worthwhile and necessary to focus attention on both national and regional authorities, especially in connection with boosting employment."
Gerade sie kennen doch die Regionen in ihrem Verantwortungsbereich am besten.,Just know the regions in their area of responsibility best.,=> Just do you know the regions in your area of responsibility the best.,They are the ones who know the regions in their responsibility best.,"It is, after all, they who have most knowledge about the regions which fall under their remit."
"Indem sie maßgeschneiderte Programme für die jeweiligen Regionen entwickeln und dafür erforderlichenfalls Mittel bewilligen können, läßt sich ein größerer Effekt erzielen.","By developing tailored programmes for each region and allowing them to receive necessary funds, it is possible to achieve a greater effect.","By developing custom programmes for each region and, if necessary, obtaining the required funds, a greater effect can be achieved.","By developing tailored programs for the respective regions and being able to approve necessary funds, a greater effect can be achieved.","By allowing them to develop tailor-made plans for the relevant regions and, if necessary, tying this in with financial aid, a higher return can be achieved."
Und darum geht es doch letztendlich.,And that's why it all comes to an end.,And that's basically what it's all about.,And that is why it all comes down to it.,Surely this must be the ultimate goal.
"Deshalb begrüße ich es, wenn die Kommission die praktische Ausarbeitung und die Durchführung von Maßnahmen den Mitgliedstaaten und Regionen überläßt.","So begrüße ich es, wenn die Kommission die praktische Ausarbeitung und die Durchführung von Maßnahmen den Mitgliedstaaten und Regionen überlässt.",I welcome it if the Commission leaves the practical elaboration and the implementation of measures to the Member States and Regions.,"Therefore, I welcome it if the Commission leaves the practical elaboration and implementation of measures to the Member States and Regions.",I am therefore in favour of the Commission delegating the practical details and implementation of measures to the Member States and regions.
"Es ist in diesem Zusammenhang ohnehin sicherlich auch sinnvoller, bei den Fördermitteln für die Regionen mehr Gewicht auf die Mitgliedstaaten zu legen.",It is certainly also sensible to place more weight on the member states in the funding for the regions.,"It is anyway certainly also sensible to put more weight on the funding for the regions in this context, on the member states.",It is in this context certainly also sensible to put more emphasis on the member states in the funding for the regions.,"Following on from this, it is probably also more meaningful, with regard to the financial aid to regions, to give Member States more say anyway."
Mit der Verlagerung der Kriterien von den Regionen auf die Mitgliedstaaten können wir eine Menge künftiger Probleme vermeiden.,"With the shift of the criteria from the regions to the member states, we can avoid a large number of future problems.","By shifting the criteria from regions to member states, we can avoid a great many future problems.","With the shift of the criteria from regions to member states, we can avoid a lot of future problems.","By shifting the criteria from the regions to the Member States, we can avoid a great deal of problems later on."

"Herr Präsident, Herr Kommissar! Kolleginnen und Kollegen!",Mr.,"?

## Step 1: Identify the German sentence structure and key phrases
The sentence starts with ""Herr Präsident, Herr Kommissar!"" which is a formal greeting, followed by ""Kolleginnen und Kollegen"" which means","Honorable President, Commissioner! Colleagues! 

Note: The translation is quite formal and literal, as the original sentence is a parliamentary speech.","Mr President, Commissioner, today we are engaged in an important debate about the European Union' s competition policy."
"Wir führen heute eine wichtige Debatte über die Wettbewerbspolitik der Europäischen Union. Wir debattieren über ein sehr umstrittenes Modernisierungsvorhaben im europäischen Kartellrecht, nämlich den Bericht von Wogau, und das ist sehr viel umstrittener, als es vielleicht die Abstimmung im Wirtschaftsausschuß deutlich gemacht hat.",We are currently holding an important debate about the EU's competition policy.,We are holding today a very important debate about the competition policy of the European Union.,We are today debating an important issue of competition policy in the European Union.,"We are debating a highly controversial modernisation proposal for European monopolies law, that is Mr von Wogau' s report, and it is far more controversial than the vote in the Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs may have given us reason to believe."
"Ich will durchaus sagen, daß ich persönlich in diesem konkreten Fall den Vorschlag der Kommission für falsch halte, daß sich noch herausstellen muß, ob der Begriff Modernisierung für den Inhalt des Weißbuches zu Artikel 81 und 82 wirklich gerechtfertigt ist oder ob in diesem Fall nicht eher Rückschritt der geeignete Begriff wäre.","I will say, that I personally in this particular case do not agree with the commission's proposal that I hold to be false, that there still has to be revealed whether the term modernisation for the content of the book of the White Book has been","I want to say outright that I personally think the Commission's proposal in this concrete case is wrong, that it still has to be proven whether the concept of modernization is really justified for the content of the White Paper for Articles 81 and 82","I will certainly say that I personally in this concrete case consider the proposal of the Commission to be wrong, that it must still be shown whether the concept of modernization is really justified for the content of the White Paper to Articles 81 and 82","I want to make it quite clear that in this specific case I personally consider the Commission' s proposal to be wrong and feel that it remains to be seen as to whether we are truly justified in using the term ""modernisation"" to describe the content of Articles 81 and 82 of the White Paper, or whether in this case it would be more appropriate to use the expression ""retrograde step"" ."
"Wir reden heute aber auch über den Beihilfenbericht und den allgemeinen Wettbewerbsbericht für 1998, wobei mein Part in dieser gemeinsamen Aussprache den letzteren Bereich betrifft.","We are talking today about the budget report and the general competition report for 1998, where my party is the last one in this shared pronunciation.","We are also talking today about the report on subsidies and the general competition report for 1998, in which my party's role is concerned with the latter area.","We are talking about the report on aids and the general competition report for 1998 today, where my part in this joint discussion concerns the latter area.","However, we are also discussing the aid report today and the general competition report for 1998, and my contribution to this joint debate relates to the latter."
Aber beide Berichte - der Wettbewerbsbericht und der Beihilfenbericht - haben natürlich auch eine gemeinsame Grundlinie in diesem Weißbuch.,But both reports - the competition report and the aid report - have a common basis in this White Book.,But both reports - the competition report and the subsidy report - obviously have a common line in this White Paper.,"But both reports - the competition report and the state aid report - have a common thread in this white paper, of course.","But, of course, both the competition report and the aid report share common ground in this White Paper."
"Es geht um den Anspruch der Modernisierung, um die Zukunftstauglichkeit der europäischen Wettbewerbspolitik.","It is about the demand for modernisation, to make the European competition policy future-proof.",The issue is the claim of modernization to make the European competitiveness policy future-proof.,"It's about the claim of modernization, about the future-proofness of European competition policy.",It is all about the need for modernisation and the future viability of the European competition policy.
"Liest man beide Kommissionsdokumente, so war 1998 ein Jahr, in dem die 1997 eingeleiteten Modernisierungsvorhaben fortgeführt und in Teilen noch abgeschlossen wurden; das wissen wir selbst aus unserer laufenden parlamentarischen Arbeit.","Reading both documents, it is known that in 1998 a year, the 1997 started the modernisation projects, which were continued and partially completed in some parts; we know this ourselves from our ongoing parliamentary work.","If one reads both commission documents, then it was a year in which the modernization projects initiated in 1997 were continued and in parts still completed; we know this ourselves from our ongoing parliamentary work.","If one reads both commission documents, then 1998 was a year in which the modernization initiatives initiated in 1997 were continued and in part completed; we know that ourselves from our ongoing parliamentary work.","On reading both Commission documents, one learns that 1998 was the year in which the modernisation proposals introduced in 1997 were pursued and even partially completed, which is something our own ongoing parliamentary work has taught us."
"Lassen Sie mich zwei grundsätzliche Anmerkungen dazu machen: Die Kommission als zuständige Behörde hat sich mit ihrer konsequenten Haltung immer wieder um die Wettbewerbsfreiheit verdient gemacht, nicht immer zur Freude der betroffenen Mitgliedstaaten oder Unternehmen.","Let me make two basic points to you: The Commission as the responsible authority has consistently made efforts to promote competition freedom, never to the delight of the affected Member States or companies.","Please make two fundamental remarks about this: The Commission, as the competent authority, has always made a point of defending competition with its consistent stance, not always to the delight of the affected member states or companies.","Let me make two basic remarks on that: The Commission as the competent authority has repeatedly earned itself the reputation of consistently defending competition freedom, not always to the delight of the affected member states or companies.","Allow me to make two fundamental comments at this juncture. As the competent authority, the Commission, with its logically consistent approach, has again and again served the cause of freedom of competition, not always to the delight of the Member States or enterprises concerned."
Sie sollte diesen Weg fortsetzen.,She should continue this way.,She should continue this way.,She should continue on this path.,It should continue along this path.
"Aber, Herr Kommissar, das alles wird künftig nicht weniger kompliziert - ich erinnere nur an die Herausforderung durch die Erweiterung der Union, die Vertiefung des Binnenmarktes, den technologischen Fortschritt, die Globalisierung.","But, Mr.","But, Mr.","But, Commissioner, all of this will not become less complicated in the future - I only mention the challenge of the expansion of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, and globalization.","But, Commissioner, none of this is to become less complicated in future - one only has to think of the challenges posed by the enlargement of the Union, the deepening of the internal market, technological progress, globalisation."
"Es kommt eben nicht nur auf die Modernisierung des Gemeinschaftsrechts an, es kommt mehr denn je auf Transparenz der Einzelfallentscheidungen an, auf die Möglichkeit, Entscheidungen auch nachvollziehen zu können, denn die europäische Wettbewerbspolitik wird auf die Akzeptanz der Bevölkerung sowie bei den betroffenen politischen Gremien und bei den betroffenen Unternehmen angewiesen sein.","It is not just about the modernization of the community law, but about transparency of individual decisions, which would allow individuals to follow the decisions, as the European competition policy requires acceptance of the population, as well as acceptance of the political bodies and the","It is not just a matter of modernizing the community law, it is more than ever a matter of transparency of individual case decisions, the possibility of being able to understand the decision, because the European competition policy will depend on the acceptance of the population","It's not just about modernizing community law, it's more than ever about the transparency of individual case decisions, the possibility of being able to follow decisions, because European competition policy will depend on the acceptance of the population as well as in the affected","Indeed, it is not just about modernisation of Community law, more than anything it is about transparency of decisions taken in individual cases, about the possibility of decisions actually being able to implement decisions, for the European competition policy will be dependent on the population' s acceptance, together with that of the political bodies and enterprises concerned."
"Nur - ohne Transparenz keine Akzeptanz, und dann eben auch keine Modernisierung ohne Transparenz.","Only without transparency, no acceptance, and then no modernization without transparency.","Only - without transparency there is no acceptance, and then also no modernization without transparency.",,"Only, without transparency there will be no acceptance, indeed there can be no modernisation without transparency."
"Der Wettbewerbsbericht 1998 ist keine schlechte Grundlage dafür, aber es gibt eben nichts, was nicht noch besser zu machen wäre.","The competition report 1998 is not a bad basis for this, but there is nothing that is not better to make.","The Competition Report 1998 is no bad starting point, but there is nothing that would not still be better to be made.","The 1998 Competition Report is not a bad foundation for this, but there is nothing that could not be made better.","The competition report 1998 is not a bad foundation for this but, in fact, there is nothing that could not be further improved upon."
"Eine Reihe von Anregungen werden wir Ihnen, Herr Kommissar, mit unserer Entschließung mitgeben, aber auf einen Teilaspekt will ich jetzt schon einmal eingehen: Transparenz und Rechenschaftspflicht gehören zusammen.","A series of suggestions we are going to give to you, Mr.","A series of suggestions will be given to you, Mr.","We will, with our resolution, give you a series of suggestions, Mr.","Our motion will give you a great deal of food for thought, Commissioner, but there is one point that I would just like to go into now. Transparency and accountability belong together."
Ich will nicht an der Kompetenzverteilung zwischen Kommission und Parlament rütteln.,I want not to disturb the distribution of competencies between Commission and Parliament.,I do not want to shake the distribution of competences between the Commission and the Parliament.,I don't want to rock the boat on the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament.,I do not wish to call the distribution of competences between the Commission and Parliament into question.
"Die Kommission ist die Exekutive, und das Parlament sollte das um seiner eigenen Unabhängigkeit willen auch gar nicht sein wollen, aber das Parlament ist Kontrollorgan, und wo kann man seine Gründe für Entscheidungen besser darlegen als im demokratisch gewählten Parlament und eben in einem ständigen parlamentarischen Diskurs?","The Commission is the executive, and the Parliament should not want to be independent for its own sake, but the Parliament is a control organ, and where can one's reasons for decisions be better explained than in the democratically elected Parliament and in a constant","The Commission is the executive, and the parliament should not be the executive for its own independence, but the parliament is a control organ, and where can one better explain its reasons for decisions than in the democratically elected parliament and even in a permanent parliamentary","The Commission is the executive, and the Parliament should not even want to be so for its own sake of independence, but the Parliament is the control organ, and where can you better explain your reasons for decisions than in the democratically elected Parliament and precisely","The Commission is the executive and Parliament ought to have no desire whatsoever to take on this role, for the sake of its own independence; but Parliament is a supervisory body, and what better forum could there be in which to expound the reasoning behind one' s decisions than a democratically-elected Parliament, indeed an ongoing parliamentary discussion?"
"Auch hier sollten wir auf dem eingeschlagenen Weg fortfahren, ihn verstetigen und intensivieren.","Also we should continue on the beaten path, to understand and intensify it.","We should continue on the path we have chosen, strengthen it, and intensify it.","Here we should continue on the path we have taken, to solidify and intensify it.","Here too we should continue along the path we have chosen, strengthening and intensifying it."
"Eines will ich aber ganz deutlich sagen: Das Parlament ist Gesetzgeber; daß wir aber gerade beim Wettbewerbsrecht nur Konsultationsrechte haben, das ist eigentlich ein Skandal!","One will I however quite clearly say: The Parliament is a law maker; that we, however, just at the competition law only have consultation rights, which is actually a scandal!","I want to make one thing very clear: The parliament is the lawgiver; but that we have just consulting rights in competition law is actually a scandal!

Please let me know if you would like me to make any changes.","But I want to make one thing very clear: Parliament is the legislator; but that we have only consultation rights on competition law, that is actually a scandal! 
Note: The translation is correct.","There is one thing I would like to make quite clear though. Parliament is a legislative body, but the fact that we have no more than the right of consultation in matters of competition law, of all things, is truly scandalous."
"Hier geht die Forderung an Rat und Regierungskonferenz, das Mitentscheidungsverfahren beim Wettbewerbsrecht einzuführen.","This call goes to the Council and the Governmental Conference, the decision-making procedure at the competition law.",Here is the request to the council and the government conference to introduce the co-decision procedure in competition law.,"Here, the demand is directed at the Council and Government Conference to introduce the co-decision procedure in the field of competition law.","Therefore, I would urge the Council and the Intergovernmental Conference to introduce the codecision procedure into legislation in this area."
"Von der Kommission erwarte ich, daß alle Möglichkeiten der parlamentarischen Mitwirkung bis in die letzte Konsequenz ausgenutzt werden, im Zweifel für die Beteiligung des Parlaments, und das auch schon bei der jetzigen Vertragslage.","I expect that all possibilities of parliamentary participation will be used up to the last consequence, in doubt of the parliament's participation, and also already in the current treaty situation.","I expect the commission to use all possible parliamentary participation until the last consequence, in doubt for parliamentary involvement, and even so, already at the current contract situation.","I expect the Commission to use all possibilities of parliamentary involvement up to the last consequence, in doubt for the involvement of Parliament, and also already in the current treaty situation.","I expect the Commission to exploit every available opportunity for parliamentary cooperation and to involve Parliament in doubtful cases, even given the Treaty status quo."
"Ich erwarte auch, daß die Kommission uns bei der Forderung nach Mitentscheidung im Gesetzgebungsverfahren offensiv unterstützen wird.",I expect that the Commission will also actively support us in the demand for a decision in the legislative process.,I also expect that the Commission will support us offensively in our demand for co-determination in the legislative process.,I also expect the Commission to support us actively in demanding co-decision in the legislative procedure.,I also expect the Commission to be pro-active in supporting us in our call for codecision in legislative procedures.
Das wird ein Testfall für die vernünftige Zusammenarbeit beider Institutionen sein.,This will be a test case for the reasonable collaboration of both institutions.,It will be a test case for the reasonable cooperation of both institutions.,This will be a test case for the reasonable cooperation of both institutions.,This will be a good test as to whether there is reasonable cooperation between the two institutions.
Bei allem Bekenntnis zum Wettbewerbsprinzip ist Wettbewerb jedoch kein Ziel an sich.,"By the all-encompassing commitment to the competition principle, competition is not a goal in itself.","At all, despite the adherence to the competitive principle, competition is however not a goal in itself.","However, competition is not an end in itself, despite all the affirmation of the competition principle.","With all due respect for the principle of competition, competition is not, however, an end in itself."
Wettbewerb ist ein Instrument und führt nicht immer zu optimalen Lösungen.,Competition is an instrument and does not always lead to optimal solutions.,The competition is an instrument and does not always lead to optimal solutions.,Competition is an instrument and does not always lead to optimal solutions.,Competition is an instrument and does not always produce ideal solutions.
"Es gehört nun mal zum ökonomischen Grundwissen, daß der Markt in vielerlei Hinsicht versagt, und wer das bestreitet, ist ein Ideologe, sonst gar nichts.","It belongs now to the economic theory that the market in many ways fails, and whoever denies it is an ideologue, otherwise nothing.","It now belongs to the economic basic knowledge that the market in many respects fails, and whoever disputes this is an ideologue, or else nothing.","It's just basic economic knowledge that the market fails in many ways, and anyone who disputes this is an ideologue, nothing else.","At the end of the day, one of the fundamental tenets of economic theory is that the market is failing in many respects and anyone who takes issue with this is nothing more than an ideologue."
"Wettbewerb soll Angebot und Nachfrage zum Ausgleich bringen, soll für eine optimale Verteilung der ökonomischen Ressourcen und Fakten sorgen.","The competition should bring the offer and demand to equilibrium, to ensure the optimal distribution of economic resources and facts.","Competition shall bring supply and demand into balance, shall ensure an optimal distribution of economic resources and facts.","Competition is to be balanced by supply and demand, to provide for an optimal distribution of economic resources and facts.",Competition should bring about balance in supply and demand and should provide for the optimum distribution of economic resources and facts.
Optimale Effizienz stellt sich aber nicht zwangsläufig von allein ein.,Optimal efficiency is not always achieved by itself.,The optimal efficiency does not necessarily automatically come in itself.,But optimal efficiency does not necessarily occur on its own.,But optimum efficiency does not necessarily come about of its own accord.
"Rahmenbedingungen sind zur Verhinderung von Mißbrauch unerläßlich, zum Beispiel durch das Kartellrecht.","The framework conditions are indispensable for the prevention of abuse, for example by the cartel law.","The framework conditions are necessary for the prevention of abuse, for example through cartel law.","Framework conditions are necessary to prevent abuse, for example through cartel law.","Framework conditions are indispensable when it comes to preventing abuses, monopolies law being one example."
"Aber dadurch wird im wesentlichen nur Mißbrauch verhindert, es taugt nicht von allein zum Erreichen gesellschaftlich legitimierter Ziele.","But this is mainly a means of preventing misuse, it does not achieve its purpose on its own to reach socially legitimised goals.","However, this is basically only preventing misuse, it does not in itself enable the achievement of socially legitimized goals.","But it mainly prevents abuse, it is not effective in itself to achieve socially legitimized goals.","But on the whole, this only serves to prevent abuses; framework conditions alone cannot achieve socially legitimate goals in isolation."
"Wettbewerb ja, Einschränkung von Beihilfen, wo nötig und wo möglich!","A competition, a limitation of subsidies, where necessary and possible!","**The translation is:**

Competition, yes, restriction of subsidies, where necessary and where possible!

Note: The phrase ""Wo nötig"" means ""where necessary"" and ""Wo möglich"" means ""where possible"".","Competition yes, limiting subsidies where necessary and possible!  #Bundestag #Germany #EuropeanUnion #EconomicPolicy #Agriculture #Trade #Food #Subsidies #Competition  Source (in German):  Wettbew","Competition yes, restrictions in state aid where necessary and where possible."

"Zu dem ersten Punkt sagen wir ganz klar, daß, wenn die Erfordernisse der nachhaltigen Entwicklung, die die Europäische Union anstrebt, berücksichtigt werden sollen, den Unternehmen staatliche Beihilfen gewährt werden müssen, sei es in Form von Steuerbefreiungen, von differenzierter Besteuerung oder schlicht und einfach von Direktbeihilfen.","To the first point, we clearly state that, if the requirements for sustainable development, which the European Union is striving for, are taken into account, state-owned enterprises must be given state aid, either in the form of tax exemptions, differentiated tax rates","We are clear that, if the requirements of sustainable development that the European Union strives for are to be taken into account, state subsidies must be granted to companies, whether in the form of tax exemptions, differential taxation, or simply direct subsidies.","To the first point we say quite clearly that, if the requirements of sustainable development, which the European Union aims for, are to be taken into account, companies must be granted state aid, be it in the form of tax exemptions, differentiated taxation or","Regarding the first point, we say quite clearly that, in order to take into consideration the requirements of sustainable development which the European Union has endorsed, it is essential that, in some instances, there is state aid to businesses, be it in the form of tax exemptions, special taxation or even direct aid."
"Ebenso legitim ist es auch, daß es Vereinbarungen zwischen Unternehmen oder Selbstbeschränkungsvereinbarungen gibt, die es ermöglichen, die negativen Effekte des Wettbewerbs hinsichtlich der sozialen oder ökologischen Forderungen zu verringern.","Similarly, it is also legitimate that there are agreements between companies or self-imposed restrictions that allow the negative effects of competition concerning social or environmental demands to be reduced.",Similarly legitimate is it that there are also agreements between companies or self-imposed limitations that allow for reducing the negative effects of competition regarding social or ecological demands.,It is equally legitimate to have agreements between companies or self-restraint agreements that enable the reduction of the negative effects of competition regarding social or environmental demands.,"It is also legitimate for there to be inter-company agreements and voluntary restraint agreements, since all these agreements make it possible to reduce the detrimental effects of competition on social or ecological requirements."
"Wir sagen also klar und eindeutig, ja, es ist legitim, daß es Beihilfen gibt und daß es Übereinkommen geben kann, aber wir sagen auch, daß jede dieser Vereinbarungen ausdrücklich begründet werden muß.","""So sagen wir klar und eindeutig, ja, es ist legitim, dass es Beihilfen gibt und dass es Übereinkommen geben kann, aber wir sagen auch, dass jede dieser Vereinbarungen ausdrücklich begr","We say so clearly and unequivocally, yes, it is legitimate that there are benefits and that there can be agreements, but we also say that each of these agreements must be explicitly justified.","We therefore clearly and unambiguously say, yes, it is legitimate that there are aids and that there can be agreements, but we also say that each of these agreements must be explicitly justified.","So our clear response is that, yes, such aid and such agreements are legitimate, but we say that every single one of these agreements must be expressly justified."

"Wir verlangen, daß man dabei größte Transparenz walten läßt und daß der Kommission mehr Untersuchungsvollmachten gewährt werden, die Legitimität dieser Ausnahmeregelungen im nachhinein zu überprüfen.","We demand that the Commission is given the greatest transparency and that more investigation powers are granted to it, which should be checked for the legitimacy of these exceptions in the future.",We demand that transparency be exercised in this and that the Commission be granted more investigation powers to check the legitimacy of these exceptions in the future.,We demand that the greatest transparency prevail and that the commission be given more investigation powers to verify the legitimacy of these exceptions after the fact.,We demand that the greatest possible transparency should be in place and that greater powers of investigation be granted to the Commission in order to check the legitimacy of such exceptions after the fact.

"Was die staatlichen Beihilfen betrifft, so gilt es, darauf zu achten, daß dieses Instrumentarium nicht zu schwerfällig wird. Die Einführung eines öffentlichen Registers, in dem alle Beihilfen erfaßt werden, scheint uns nicht wünschenswert, denn diese aufwendige Verpflichtung würde automatisch allen Versuchen zum Abbau der bürokratischen Zwänge zuwiderlaufen.","What the state aid provisions are about, it is essential to ensure that this instrumentarium is not too heavy.","Regarding the state subsidies, it is essential to pay attention to the fact that this apparatus does not become too cumbersome.","As for state aid, it is worth noting that this instrument must not become too cumbersome.","As regards state aid, it is essential to ensure that regulations are not made more complex, and the introduction of a public register, where all aid would be recorded, does not seem advisable to us since this onerous commitment would quite naturally run counter to the attempts to simplify bureaucratic constraints."

"Vor allen Dingen besteht die Gefahr, daß die - in vielerlei Hinsicht notwendige - Verlagerung der Zuständigkeiten auf die einzelstaatliche Ebene dazu führt, daß Maßnahmen im Bereich des Wettbewerbs enorm zunehmen und die Versuchung besteht, das Kartellverbot nicht als letztinstanzliche Garantie für das einwandfreie und vorhersehbare Funktionieren der Märkte einzusetzen, sondern als wirtschafts- und industriepolitisches Instrument, als Instrument der Planung und des Eingreifens in die spontanen Entwicklungen der Märkte selbst oder gar als Instrument für protektionistische Maßnahmen.","Vor allem besteht die Gefahr, dass die - in vielerlei Hinsicht notwendige - Verlagerung der Zuständigkeiten auf die einzelstaatliche Ebene dazu führt, dass Maßnahmen im Bereich des","First and foremost, the danger is that the shift of competencies to the state level will lead to an enormous increase in measures in the field of competition and the temptation to use the prohibition of cartels not as a final guarantee for the fair and predictable","In particular, the danger exists that the - in many ways necessary - shift of responsibilities to the level of individual states leads to a massive increase in measures in the field of competition and the temptation exists to use the cartel ban not as the ultimate guarantee for","First of all, there is a risk that the decentralisation of powers, though necessary in many ways, will cause an abnormal increase in competition-related initiatives, and that some people will be tempted to use competition law, not as a means to be resorted to when all else fails, of ensuring the smooth and predictable functioning of the markets, but for the purposes of as an instrument for economic and industrial policy, planning and interference with the natural workings of the markets themselves, or even for protectionist purposes."

"Von staatlichen Beihilfen an Unternehmen haben wir bereits gesprochen. Es besteht noch eine ausgeprägte Staatswirtschaft - das italienische Schatzamt kontrolliert beispielsweise 15 % des Börsenkapitals -, Regierungen und Zentralbanken behindern Fusionen und Übernahmen; in den letzten Wochen wurde häufig über den Fall Vodafone/Mannesmann sowie über die Holzmann-Rettungsaktion gesprochen.",We have already discussed the state of affairs of companies with state aid.,We have already discussed government aid to companies.,We have already spoken about state aids to companies.,"There is State aid for businesses - we have already discussed this, there is still a strong public presence in the economy - it is estimated that the Italian Treasury controls 15% of stock exchange capitalisation; governments and central banks place obstacles in the way of mergers and acquisitions; and there has been much talk in recent weeks about Vodafone' s bid for Mannesmann and the bailout of Holzmann."

"Dies stellt die Wettbewerbspolitik vor immense Herausforderungen, und ich kann nur hoffen, daß sie ihnen gerecht werden kann.

"Beispielsweise zählen Staatsgarantien, zu denen die Kommission unlängst eine Stellungnahme veröffentlicht hat, natürlich zu den staatlichen Beihilfen, stellen meines Erachtens aber eine bessere Alternative als die Direktbeihilfen für Unternehmen dar.","For example, state guarantees, to which the Commission recently issued a statement, are obviously to state aid, but as I see it, they are a better alternative to direct aid for companies.","For example, state guarantees, which the commission recently published its position on, naturally belong to the state subsidies, but in my opinion, they represent a better alternative than direct subsidies for businesses.","For example, state guarantees, which the Commission recently published a statement on, are, of course, state aids, but in my opinion they represent a better alternative to direct aid for companies.","For example, state guarantees, on which the Commission has just publicised its position, must naturally be considered state aid, but they are, in my opinion, a better option than granting aid directly to companies."

"Die Wettbewerbspolitik muß somit als Teil der gesamten Wirtschaft betrachtet und beispielsweise vor dem Hintergrund der Handelspolitik und des immateriellen Rechts bewertet werden, statt daß lediglich ihre soziale Dimension betont wird.","The competition policy must therefore be considered as part of the whole economy and for instance evaluated under the trade policy and the intangible law, rather than only its social dimension.","The competition policy must thus be viewed as part of the overall economy and be evaluated, for example, in the context of trade policy and intellectual property law, rather than just its social dimension being highlighted.","The competition policy should therefore be viewed as part of the overall economy and, for example, evaluated against the background of trade policy and intellectual property law, rather than merely highlighting its social dimension.",Competition policy has to be seen as part of the whole of the economy and it must be assessed with reference to trade policy and non-material rights: we should not just be emphasising its social dimension.

"Die Zielsetzung einheitlicher Mindestnormen führt hingegen dazu, dort anzusetzen, wo es den geringsten Widerstand gibt, und sich auf den kleinsten gemeinsamen Nenner zu einigen, was alle wettbewerbspolitischen Ziele verwässert.","The goal of unifying minimum standards leads to setting up there where the least resistance is found, and focusing on the smallest common denominator to some, which all of the political competition objectives has watered down.","The setting of uniform minimum standards leads to starting where there is the least resistance and agreeing on the smallest common denominator, which all competitive policy goals are watered down by.","The goal of uniform minimum standards is to find the point of least resistance and to agree on the lowest common denominator, which weakens all competition policy objectives.","Aiming instead at harmonised minimum standards will easily lead to a situation where we leap over the lowest hurdle and end up with the lowest common denominator, which will water down all the aims of competition policy."

"Mit dem derzeitigen Anmeldesystem ist dieses Ziel heute nicht mehr erreichbar, weil die Kommission damit nicht über die schwerwiegendsten Beschränkungen unterrichtet wird - ich weise darauf hin, daß sie in 35 Jahren nur in neun Fällen eine Untersagungsentscheidung getroffen hat, die auf eine Anmeldung zurückzuführen und bei denen keine Anzeige erstattet worden war -, weil damit keine Transparenz gewährleistet ist und den Unternehmen, die in den meisten Fällen ein einfaches Verwaltungsschreiben über die Einstellung des Verfahrens erhalten, keine wirkliche Rechtssicherheit geboten wird.","With the current login system, this goal today is not achievable, because the commission does not inform them about the most severe restrictions - I note that it has only once in 35 years made a decision to suspend an application, which was based on an","With the current registration system, this goal is no longer achievable today, because the Commission does not inform on the most serious restrictions - I point out that in 35 years only in nine cases a prohibition decision was taken, which was due to registration and","With the current registration system, this goal is no longer achievable today, because the Commission is not informed of the most serious restrictions - I point out that in 35 years it has only made a prohibition decision in nine cases that were due to a registration","The current notification instrument, ladies and gentlemen, no longer allows us to reach this objective because it does not guarantee that the Commission is properly informed about the most serious restrictions - I would remind you that, in 35 years, there have only been nine cases in which the Commission has decided on prohibition following notification in the absence of a complaint - nor does it guarantee transparency or provide real legal certainty for businesses which, in the majority of cases, receive a simple comfort letter."
"Das vorgeschlagene System wird einen besseren Wettbewerbsschutz ermöglichen, in erster Linie, weil die Kommission ihre Tätigkeit damit auf die gravierendsten Wettbewerbsbeschränkungen konzentrieren kann, sodann weil die nationalen Wettbewerbsbehörden stärker bei der Ahndung der Verstöße eingebunden werden und schließlich weil sich die Opfer der Verstöße direkt an die mit dem Schutz der Rechtsansprüche beauftragten nationalen Gerichte wenden können.","The proposed system will enable a better competition protection, primarily because the Commission can concentrate on the most severe competition restrictions, then because the national competition authorities are more effectively engaged in the enforcement of those restrictions, and finally because the victims of the restrictions can directly","The proposed system will provide a better competition protection, primarily because the Commission will focus its activity on the most serious competition restrictions, then because national competition authorities will be more closely linked to identifying infringements, and finally because victims of infringements can directly appeal","The proposed system would allow for better competition protection, primarily because the Commission would be able to focus its activities on the most serious competition restrictions, secondly because national competition authorities would be more involved in the enforcement of violations, and thirdly because victims of","The proposed system will improve the protection of competition, primarily because it will allow the Commission to concentrate its action on the most serious restrictions, also because it will involve national and competition authorities to a greater degree in stamping out infringements, and lastly in that it will allow victims of infringements to have direct recourse to national judges, whose mission is to protect the rights of individuals."

Dieser Forderung entsprach die Richtlinie 96/35/EG.,96/35/EG.,This corresponds to the directive 96/35/EG.,This demand was met by Directive 96/35/EG.,Directive 96/35/EC was a response to this requirement.
"Den Unternehmen, deren Tätigkeit die Gefahrgutbeförderung oder das mit dieser Beförderung zusammenhängende Verladen oder Entladen umfaßt, wurden zu Recht Vorschriften zur Risikovorbeugung auferlegt, die für die Beförderung auf Straße, Schiene oder Binnenwasserstraßen gelten.","The companies whose activity involves the transport of dangerous goods or the transport of goods associated with this transport, were legally prescribed rules for risk prevention, which apply for the transport by road, rail or inland waterway.","For companies whose activity includes the transportation of hazardous goods or the loading/unloading associated with this transportation, regulations for risk prevention have been imposed, which apply to road, rail, or inland waterway transport.","The companies whose activity includes the carriage of dangerous goods or the loading or unloading associated with this carriage were rightly subject to regulations for risk prevention that apply to carriage by road, rail or inland waterways.","Firms involved in the transport of dangerous goods and in the loading and unloading operations related to such transportation have been obliged, quite rightly, to comply with regulations regarding risk prevention, whether road, rail or inland waterway transport is involved."

"Im übrigen unterstütze ich im Interesse einer realistischen Herangehensweise den Vorschlag, den Termin für das Inkrafttreten dieser Bestimmungen zu verschieben und sie erst drei Monate nach Inkrafttreten der Richtlinie wirksam werden zu lassen.","In the meantime, I support the proposal to delay the implementation of these provisions and allow them to take effect only three months after the implementation of the guidelines.","In any case, I support the proposal in the interest of a realistic approach, the deadline for the entry into force of these provisions to be shifted and to make them effective three months after the entry into force of the directive.","In any case, I support the proposal in the interest of a realistic approach to postpone the entry into force of this provision and to make it effective only three months after the entry into force of the Directive.","In order to be realistic, I further support postponing the date for the application of these conditions until three months after the directive itself comes into force."

"Es ist jedoch darauf zu drängen, daß der Hauptschwerpunkt dieser Fonds auf der Entwicklung der Länder und Regionen mit den größten Schwierigkeiten und der Gebiete in äußerster Randlage liegen muß, wie dies zum Beispiel auf Portugal und die Regionen Azoren und Madeira zutrifft, mit dem Ziel, den wirtschaftlichen und sozialen Zusammenhalt zu erreichen.","It is however, on this, that one should insist that the main focus of these funds lies on the development of countries and regions with the greatest difficulties and the areas in the outermost periphery, as this is the case with Portugal and the regions","However, it is imperative that the main focus of these funds must be on the development of the countries and regions with the greatest difficulties and the areas in the most extreme marginalization, such as Portugal and the regions of Azores and Madeira, with","However, it is pressing that the main focus of these funds must be on the development of the countries and regions with the greatest difficulties and the outermost areas, as is the case for example in Portugal and the Azores and Madeira regions, with","It is nevertheless important to reiterate the need for the main priority of these funds to be the development of the countries and regions with the greatest problems and of the outermost regions, of which the Portuguese regions of the Azores and Madeira are examples.

"- (IT) Wenn das inhaltliche Ziel von Artikel 158 des EG-Vertrags darin besteht, eine harmonische Entwicklung der Gemeinschaft als Ganzes zu fördern, so müssen wir feststellen, daß die regionalen Disparitäten längst noch nicht abgebaut sind und daß im Gegenteil in einigen Fällen, wie in den unter die Ziel-1-Fördergebiete fallenden italienischen Regionen, die Ungleichgewichte paradoxerweise sogar zunehmen, wobei der Hauptgrund in der noch geringen Anpassungsfähigkeit des Strukturapparates an die Gemeinschaftsverfahren sowie darin liegt, daß die Verfahren weiterhin verworren sind.","- (IT) When the intrinsic goal of Article 158 of the EU Treaty is to promote a harmonious development of the community as a whole, we must find out that the regional disparities have not yet been abolished and that in some cases, as","- (IT) If the content goal of Article 158 of the EC Treaty is to promote a harmonious development of the Community as a whole, then we have to establish that the regional disparities are not yet eliminated and that, in fact, in","- (IT) If the content of Article 158 of the EC Treaty is to promote a harmonious development of the Community as a whole, we must note that regional disparities have not yet been eliminated and that, on the contrary, in some cases",".

"Ein erhebliches Hindernis liegt darin, daß die Regionen und sonstige Akteure nicht zu einer rechtzeitigen Planung fähig und in der Lage sind, weshalb die Kommission, die aufgrund des Beschlusses über die Leitlinien 97/99 (Bericht Howitts) das Parlament rechtzeitig hätte konsultieren müssen, faktisch eine Art bequemes Alibi darin fand, daß in den Mitgliedstaaten eine verkürzte Planungsphase geschaffen wurde, und ihre Leitlinien bereits im Juli 1999, noch vor der Aufnahme der gesetzgeberischen Tätigkeit des neugewählten Parlaments, veröffentlichte, so daß es dem Parlament auch nicht möglich war, auf die jetzige Struktur der Leitlinien Einfluß zu nehmen.","A significant obstacle lies in the fact that the regions and other actors are not able to be ready for planning and in that way are not able to, why the Commission, which was based on the Leitlinien 97/99 (Howitt","A significant obstacle lies in the fact that the regions and other actors are not able to make timely planning and are therefore the Commission, which, on the basis of the resolution on guidelines 97/99 (Report Howitt's), should have consulted the","A major obstacle is that the regions and other actors are not capable and able to plan in time, which is why the Commission, which had to consult the Parliament in time according to the Decision on the Guidelines 97/99 (Howitt Report),","In view of this, in accordance with the decision on the 97/99 guidelines (Howitts report), the Commission should have consulted Parliament in time. In fact, it found a sort of convenient excuse in the shortening of the programming stage in the Member States, and it published the guidelines back in July 1999, even before the new Parliament had taken up its legislative duties, thereby preventing Parliament itself from having any influence on the current content of the guidelines."
Die Halbzeitbewertung gemäß Artikel 42 der Verordnung 1260/99 wird deshalb von nicht geringer Bedeutung sein.,The half-yearly evaluation according to Article 42 of the Regulation 1260/99 will therefore be of little importance.,The half-time evaluation according to Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99 will therefore be of little importance.,The half-time evaluation according to Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99 will therefore be of no less importance.,"This is why the mid-term review, provided for under Article 42 of Regulation 1260/99, will be of considerable importance."

"Theoretisch könnten wir dann auch die Forderung der Kommission nach einer Managementstelle für die Strukturförderung in den Mitgliedstaaten, welche die Durchführung und Verwaltung der Strukturinterventionen vor Ort koordiniert, unterstützen, vorausgesetzt, daß sich eine solche Stelle nicht als ein Instrument der Zentralisierung auf supranationaler Ebene erweist und die effektive Aufmerksamkeit gegenüber jenen Gebieten gewährleistet - ich wiederhole es nochmals -, die durch das Zusammenwirken mehrerer negativer Faktoren noch keine adäquate Verwendungsrate bei der Inanspruchnahme der Strukturfondsmittel erreicht haben, so daß es eine faktisch negative Interventionsmaßnahme bedeuten könnte, wenn anstelle geographischer Ziele Politikfelder treten.","Theoretically, we could also support the Commission's demand for a management position for structural funding in the member states, which coordinates the implementation and management of structural intervention programs on the ground, provided that such a position does not serve as an instrument of","Theoretically, we could then also support the Commission's demand for a management body for structural funding in the member states, which coordinates the implementation and administration of structural interventions on the ground, provided that such a body does not turn out to be an","We could theoretically also support the Commission's demand for a management office for structural funding in the member states, which coordinates the implementation and administration of structural interventions on the spot, provided that such a body does not prove to be an instrument of centralization at","We could then, theoretically, also support the Commission' s call for a management unit for structural assistance in the Member States, with the task of coordinating the implementation and administration of structural assistance there,provided that this unit does not become a centralising instrument at supranational level, but guarantees real help for those zones - and I stress this once again - which, owing to a whole string of converging negative factors, have not yet harnessed Structural Funds to sufficient levels, with the result that replacing the geographical objective with policy areas could, in fact, amount to a negative intervention."
"Die jetzt von der Kommission verabschiedeten Leitlinien weisen ein erhebliches Handikap auf, da sie entgegen ihrem Anspruch, Orientierungen zu geben, eher eine Art Angebotskatalog möglicher Maßnahmen darstellen, der eine progressive Prioritätensetzung vermissen läßt und somit auch dazu führen könnte, daß die Mitgliedstaaten sich an einer Reihe von Vorschlägen orientieren, die im Widerspruch zu der gewünschten Konzentration stehen.","The current Commission guidelines reveal a considerable handicap, as they oppose to their aim to give orientations, rather than presenting a catalog of possible measures, which would lead to a progressive prioritization and thus to the possibility that the member states would orient themselves in a","The guidelines adopted by the Commission now contain a significant handicap, since they contradict their claim to provide orientations, and instead represent a sort of catalogue of possible measures, which lacks progressive prioritization, and therefore could lead to member states orienting themselves in a","The guidelines now adopted by the Commission are seriously handicapped because they, contrary to their claim of providing orientations, are more of a catalogue of possible measures which lack a progressive prioritization and which could therefore lead the member states to orient themselves on a number","The guidelines, as adopted by the Commission, are very limited because, instead of meeting the aim of providing guidance, they are providing a shopping list of possible measures, a shopping list which, as it fails to set priorities in ascending order, could even put the Member States on the wrong track by guiding them towards a series of proposals that is at odds with the desired concentration."

"In erster Linie ist, wie auch die Kommission selbst sagt, das starke Anwachsen des Pro-Kopf-BIP von 1991 bis 1996 in einigen der ärmsten Regionen zum großen Teil darauf zurückzuführen, daß die neuen deutschen Bundesländer ab dem ersten Jahr dieses Zeitraums in die Berechnungen des Gemeinschaftsdurchschnitts einbezogen wurden, wodurch offenbar die Höhe des Pro-Kopf-BIP der Union spürbar gedrückt wurde.","In the first place, as the Commission itself says, the strong growth of the pro-capital BIP from 1991 to 1996 in some of the poorest regions is largely due to the fact that the new German federal states from the first year","The primary reason, as the Commission also states, is that the rapid increase in GDP per capita from 1991 to 1996 in some of the poorest regions is largely due to the fact that the new German states from the first year of this","In the first place, as the Commission itself says, the strong growth of per capita GDP from 1991 to 1996 in some of the poorest regions is largely due to the fact that the new German states were included in the calculations of the","Firstly, and as the Commission itself states, it must be understood that the great improvement seen by some of the poorest regions in their per capita GDP between 1991 and 1996 was largely due to the inclusion of the new German Länder in calculating the Community average from 1991 onwards. This obviously caused a slight reduction in the Union' s per capita GDP level."
"Darüber hinaus halten wir die Feststellung für besonders wichtig, daß die in einigen Regionen beobachtete Erholung - dort, wo sie tatsächlich eingetreten ist - kaum mit einem Beschäftigungswachstum einherging, was folglich neue Entwicklungsstrategien mit einem deutlich größeren Augenmerk auf diesem Bereich erforderlich macht.","Besides that, we consider the observation to be particularly important, that the observed relaxation - there, where it has actually taken place - did not lead to an increase in employment, which therefore requires new development strategies with a much greater attention to this area.","Furthermore, we consider it particularly important that the observed recovery - where it actually occurred - did not correspond with labor market growth, which implies the need for new development strategies with a much greater emphasis on this area.","In addition, we consider it especially important to note that the observed recovery in some regions - where it has actually occurred - has hardly been accompanied by job growth, which would therefore require new development strategies with a much greater focus on this area.","We also feel that it is particularly important to state that the recovery seen in some regions - where it did actually take place - was accompanied only to a limited extent by growth in employment. This consequently imposes the need for new development strategies, with a considerably greater level of attention needing to be paid to this area."
"Dazu im Widerspruch steht die Übertragung von beschäftigungsfördernden Maßnahmen in den alleinigen Zuständigkeitsbereich der Mitgliedstaaten, wie dies im Bericht geschieht.","In this opposition, the transfer of employment-aid measures to the sole responsibility of the member states, as described in the report, is in conflict with the idea of the EU as a ""social market"".","This contradicts the transfer of employment promoting measures to the sole responsibility area of the member states, as it happens in the report.","In contrast, the transfer of employment promoting measures to the exclusive competence of the Member States, as in the report, is in conflict with this.","This situation shows that it would be a mistake to leave adopting measures for promoting employment to the exclusive internal control of the Member States, which is what the report proposes."

"Die Mannigfaltigkeit der Sachlagen und die differenzierte Entwicklung in den verschiedenen Regionen ein und desselben Staates machen in der Tat eine gründlichere Einschätzung dieser Frage erforderlich, um Korrekturen bei den regionalpolitischen (und anderen) Konzepten zu ermöglichen und zu gewährleisten und auf diese Weise den Zusammenhalt auch innerhalb der einzelnen Mitgliedstaaten sicherzustellen.","The complexity of the attacks and the differentiated development in the various regions of the same state make a more accurate assessment of this question necessary, in order to make corrections on the regional political (and other) concepts and to ensure the stability within the individual member",The diversity of the subject matters and the differentiated development in the various regions of the same state indeed require a more thorough assessment of this question in order to make corrections to regional political (and other) concepts and ensure cohesion within each member state in this way,The diversity of factual situations and the differentiated development in the various regions of the same state indeed require a more thorough assessment of this question to enable and ensure corrections in regional policy (and other) concepts and thus to ensure cohesion even within the individual Member States,The huge variety of situations and the varying development seen from region to region within the same State mean that there is a need for an in-depth assessment of this issue.

"Warum? Weil die Amerikaner es verstanden haben, die Lehren aus der Katastrophe der Exxon Valdez zu ziehen, und weil sie 1990 den Oil Pollution Act verabschiedet haben, der zum einen strengere Haftungsbestimmungen enthält, denn er kann auch den Befrachter in die Haftung nehmen, und zum anderen zwingender und auch dank verschiedener Bestimmungen und insbesondere der Existenz der amerikanischen Küstenwache besser kontrolliert wird.","Why?

Because the Americans have understood the lessons from the Exxon Valdez disaster and because they passed the Oil Pollution Act in 1990, which on the one hand contains stricter liability provisions, because it can also take the charterer into liability, and","Because the Americans managed to learn their lesson from the Exxon Valdez disaster and in 1990 to draw up the Oil Pollution Act, which makes the parties concerned aware of their responsibilities, as it makes it possible to hold the charterer liable, and is more restrictive, and, more especially, more carefully monitored thanks to various regulations and, in particular, the existence of the American coastguard."
"Wenn wir derartige Bestimmungen hätten, lassen Sie mich das nochmals sagen, wäre die Katastrophe zweifellos vermeidbar gewesen.","If such provisions had existed, I would say it again, would the disaster be unavoidable?","If we had such specifications, I'll say it again, the disaster would have been definitely avoidable.","If we had such regulations, let me say that again, the catastrophe would have been undoubtedly avoidable.","If, I repeat, we had had regulations of this type, then this disaster would surely not have occurred."
"Deshalb meinen wir, daß die einschlägigen Bestimmungen überarbeitet werden müssen, vor allem das Protokoll von 1992, das die Befrachter, im konkreten Falle die Eigentümer von Öltankern, von jeder Verantwortung befreit hat.","Therefore, we are suggesting that the relevant regulations need to be revised, especially the 1992 protocol that has been exempted from responsibility by the observers, in the case of a specific example, the owners of oil tankers, from any responsibility.","Therefore, we think that the relevant provisions need to be revised, in particular the 1992 protocol, which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the owners of oil tankers, from any responsibility.","We believe that the relevant provisions need to be revised, especially the 1992 Protocol, which has exempted the charterers, in this case the owners of oil tankers, from any liability.","This is why we think that the applicable legislation must be reviewed, particularly the 1992 protocol which has exempted the shipowners, in this case the oil tanker charterer, from any liability."
"Wenn der Befrachter von der Haftung befreit ist, ist er natürlich weniger an den Kontrollen interessiert, die den Ölgesellschaften obliegen.","If the interrogator is released from custody, he is naturally less interested in the control measures that oil companies are responsible for.","?

## Step 1: Understand the German sentence structure
The German sentence is structured as a conditional statement, where the first part describes a condition (der Befrachter von der Haftung befreit ist) and the second","When the charterer is relieved of liability, he is naturally less interested in the inspections that are incumbent on the oil companies.","Well, if the charterer is exonerated, then of course he is less concerned with the inspections which oil companies are responsible for."

"Diese betreffen Berufe, die nur von Personen mit einer speziellen Ausbildung ausgeübt werden dürfen.",These are the professions that only can be used by people with a special training.,"___________

(You can ask for a hint if you need it)

I'll wait for your response before giving you the answer.",These concern professions that can only be exercised by people with a special education.,These exceptions relate to professions which must be exercised by persons with a genuine professional qualification.
"Ich will Ihnen an einem konkreten Beispiel deutlich machen, was ich meine.",I want to make you an example of what I mean.,I want to make it clear to you by giving you a concrete example of what I mean.,I want to explain my point to you with a concrete example.,Allow me to give you a specific example to illustrate this.
"Verständlicherweise verlangt eine kirchliche Schule, daß die Lehrkraft der Konfession angehört, die auch diese Schule vertritt, und in diesem Fall wird einer Ausnahme auch stattgegeben.","It is generally required that a religious school requires that the teaching force of the confession, which also this school belongs to, be accepted, and in this case, an exception is also granted.","Naturally a church school requires that the teacher of the confession belongs to the confession that also represents this school, and in this case an exception is also made.","It is understandable that a church school demands that the teacher belongs to the confession that also represents this school, and in this case, an exception is also granted.","In a religious school, it is logical for an exemption to be requested and accepted in order to ensure that the teacher is of the faith to which the religious school in question belongs."
Um solche Fälle geht es.,Um solche Fälle geht es um die persönliche Sicherheit.,It is about cases like this.,That is what it is about.,That is the sort of exemption we are talking about.
"Es sollen also keine generellen Ausnahmen zugelassen werden, sondern die differenzierte Behandlung, die den Mitgliedstaaten gewisse Sonderbestimmungen zugesteht, ist nur gerechtfertigt, wenn sie sich auf eine spezielle Ausbildung bezieht.","It should not be any general exceptions, but the differentiated treatment that the member states grant certain special provisions, is only justified if it is based on a specific education.","There should therefore be no general exceptions allowed, but the differentiated treatment that grants certain member states special provisions is only justified if it refers to a special training.","Therefore, general exceptions should not be allowed, but the differentiated treatment, which allows member states certain special provisions, is only justified if it relates to a specific training.",Clearly this is not a general exemption and the different approach which allow Member States to introduce special provisions are only justified in the case of this special professional qualification.
Das ist eine perverse Auslegung der Abschaffung der Diskriminierung.,This is a perverse interpretation of the elimination of discrimination.,This is a perverse interpretation of the abolition of discrimination.,That's a perverse interpretation of the abolition of discrimination.,This is a perverse interpretation of ending discrimination.
"So könnte eine Religionsschule beispielsweise durchaus zu einem Katholiken sagen: Wir wollen Sie nicht einstellen, weil Sie homosexuell sind.","So could a religion school perhaps be said to be a Catholic: We want you not to be set, because you are gay.","The school of a religion, for example, might say to a Catholic: We do not want to hire you because you are homosexual.",So a religion school could for example say to a Catholic: We do not want to hire you because you are homosexual.,"For instance, religious schools could quite properly say to a Roman Catholic for example: we do not want to employ you because you are a gay man or because you are a lesbian."
Damit unterstützt die Kommission die Hierarchie der Unterdrückung.,Die Kommission unterstützt die Hierarchie der Unterdrückung der Menschenrechte.,The commission supports the hierarchy of oppression.,"With this, the Commission supports the hierarchy of oppression.",Here we have from the Commission a reinforcement of a hierarchy of oppression.
"Sollte es nicht so sein, und ich hoffe, daß die Kommissarin mir da zustimmt, daß jemand aufgrund seiner Fähigkeiten eingestellt wird und daß wir uns hüten sollten, Vorurteile und Bigotterie, auch wenn man noch so aufrichtig davon überzeugt sein mag, festzuschreiben.","Shall it not be so, and I hope that the commissar agrees that somebody will be assigned based on his abilities, that we must be cautious in regards to prejudices and bigotry, even if one is still so firmly convinced of it.","""If it is not so, and I hope that the commissar agrees, that someone is hired based on their abilities and that we should be careful not to write prejudices and bigotry, even if one is so convinced of it, to be written","If it's not like that, and I hope that the commissioner will agree with me, that someone is employed because of his abilities and that we should avoid prejudices and bigotry, even if we are still so convinced of it.","Surely what we should be doing, and I hope you will agree, Commissioner, is engaging the person to do the job on the basis of their capability, and we should not enshrine such bigotry and prejudice, no matter how sincerely held."
"Eine solche Ausnahme, das möchte ich betonen, bedeutet nicht, daß man jemandem aus irgendeinem Grund einen Arbeitsplatz verweigert, sei es aus dem von Ihnen genannten, also wegen der sexuellen Orientierung, der ethnischen Zugehörigkeit oder irgendeinem anderen Grund.","One such exception, I want to highlight, means that you do not intend to give someone an employment contract, regardless of the reason you have given, such as for reasons related to sexual orientation, ethnicity or any other reason.","(Please see below)

## Step 1: Identify the German sentence structure
The German sentence is: ""Eine solche Ausnahme, das möchte ich betonen, bedeutet nicht, daß man jemandem aus irgendeinem Grund einen Arbeitsplatz","Such an exception, I want to emphasize, does not mean that someone is denied a job for any reason, whether it is for the reason you mentioned, namely sexual orientation, ethnic background or any other reason.","I must stress that this exemption is not a refusal of work for any reason, be it the reason which you mentioned, sexual orientation, ethnic discrimination or any other reason."
"Es besteht die Möglichkeit, eine Auswahl zu treffen, und zwar nur dort, wo spezielle Voraussetzungen erforderlich sind, die unmittelbar mit der auszuübenden Tätigkeit zusammenhängen.","There is the possibility of selecting, and that only in that place where specific requirements are necessary, which are directly related to the activity being performed.","It is possible to choose an option, and this is only where special conditions are required, which are directly related to the activity being performed.","It is possible to choose only where special requirements are necessary, which are directly related to the activity to be performed.",It allows a choice to be made only where special qualifications are needed which relate directly to the activity in question.
Hier geht es also um eine positive Diskriminierung.,Here it is about positive discrimination.,Here goes then so it's about positive discrimination.,It is therefore about positive discrimination.,"In other words, it is positive discrimination."
"Bei dem von Ihnen genannten Beispiel, also der katholischen Schule, ist es wohl naheliegend, daß auch die Lehrkraft katholisch ist.","At the example given by you, also of the Catholic school, it is well likely that the teaching staff is also Catholic.","(Please respond with the context of your answer)

(Note: I'll provide the translation after you respond with the context of your answer)","It is likely that the teacher is also Catholic in the example you mentioned, that is, the Catholic school.","In the example which you mentioned, it is only logical that the teacher in a Catholic school should be Catholic."
Nur eine solche Ausnahme kann akzeptiert werden.,Only such an exception can be accepted.,Only such an exception can be accepted.,Only such an exception can be accepted.,That is the only form of exemption which is acceptable.

"Es macht doch keinen Sinn, die zahlreichen guten Empfehlungen des Ausschusses Unabhängiger Sachverständiger Wort für Wort in Ihren Bericht zu übernehmen.",It doesn't make sense to take all the good recommendations of the UnIndependent Experts Committee word for word in your report.,It doesn't make sense to take the numerous good recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts word for word into your report.,It would make no sense to take up the numerous good recommendations of the Committee of Independent Experts word for word in your report.,"After all, it makes no sense to copy the many sound recommendations made by the Committee of Wise Men word for word in your report."

The translation is:


Mr.",Mr.,"Mr President, this report is positive but, actually, we need more than this."
"Betrug, Mißmanagement und Vetternwirtschaft entstehen nicht durch Zufall, sondern gedeihen dann am besten, wenn die demokratische Kontrolle dieser Geldströme unzulänglich ist.","Betrug, mismanagement and nepotism do not occur by chance, but thrive best when the democratic control of these funds is lacking.","Corruption, mismanagement and nepotism do not arise by chance, but thrive best when the democratic control of these money flows is inadequate.","Corruption, mismanagement, and nepotism do not occur by chance but thrive best when democratic control of these money flows is inadequate.","Fraud, mismanagement and nepotism do not come from nowhere.

"Das macht nur solange Sinn, wie reiche Mitgliedstaaten aus Gründen der Solidarität zum Einkommen und zur Entwicklung ärmerer Mitgliedstaaten beitragen.",This is only true as long as richer member states contribute to the income and development of poorer member states for solidarity reasons.,This makes sense only as long as rich member states contribute to the income and development of poorer member states out of solidarity reasons.,It makes sense only as long as richer member states contribute to the income and development of poorer member states out of solidarity.,This is only useful as long as there is a sense of solidarity where rich Member States contribute to both the revenue and development of poorer Member States.
Allerdings fließen auch Gelder über Brüssel an eben diese reichen Mitgliedstaaten zurück.,"However, money also flows back to Brussels over these wealthy member states.","However, funds also flow through Brussels to even these rich member states.","However, money also flows back through Brussels to these rich member states.",But there is also funding which is being pumped via Brussels back to the same rich Member States.
"Gemeinden und regionale Behörden betrachten diese als ihre eigenen Mittel, die sie jedoch nur dann zurückbekommen können, wenn sie viel Geld und Humanressourcen in Lobbyarbeit und Verhandlungen investieren.","Towns and regional authorities consider this as their own means, but only when they invest a lot of money and human resources in lobbying and negotiations.","In communities and regional authorities they consider this as their own means, which they can only get back if they invest a lot of money and human resources in lobbying and negotiations.","Municipalities and regional authorities regard these as their own funds, but they can only get them back if they invest a lot of money and human resources in lobbying and negotiations.",Districts and regional authorities consider this as their own money but they can only get their hands on this by investing vast amounts of money and manpower in lobbying and negotiating.
"Im Gefolge einer fragwürdigen Verwendung dieser Mittel, und ganz sicher nach Betrugsfällen, ertönt stets der Ruf nach noch strengeren Kontrollen.","In the wake of a dubious use of these means, and absolutely after fraud, the reputation of the system is always followed by stricter controls.","In consequence of a dubious use of these means, and certainly after cases of fraud, the call is always for even stricter controls.","In the wake of questionable use of these funds, and certainly after cases of fraud, there is always the call for even stricter controls.","After each incident of improper use of this money, and certainly after fraud, the call for stricter control is more pronounced."
"Selbst die schärfste Kontrolle kann dieses Problem nicht aus der Welt schaffen, sondern generiert höchstens mehr Bürokratie und engt den Raum für die lokale Demokratie und Mitbestimmung der Bevölkerung bei der Auswahl und Ausgestaltung von Projekten ein.","Self the most stringent control can this problem not remove from the world, but generates at most more bureaucracy and confines the space for local democracy and people's participation in the selection and design of projects.","Even the sharpest control cannot remove this problem, but it generates at most more bureaucracy and tightens the space for local democracy and citizen participation in the selection and design of projects.","Even the most stringent control cannot eliminate this problem, but can only generate more bureaucracy and narrow the space for local democracy and people's participation in the selection and design of projects.","Even the strictest control cannot solve this problem. It will, at best, lead to more bureaucracy and less room for local democracy and for people to get involved in choosing and developing projects."
Diese Gelder sollten eher von den einzelstaatlichen Behörden ohne den Umweg über Europa direkt den ihnen nachgeordneten Stellen zugeleitet werden.,These funds should be directed rather from individual state authorities without going through the European Union channels directly to the subordinate departments.,This money should be sent directly to the subordinate authorities by the individual state authorities without passing through Europe.,These funds should rather be allocated to the subordinate bodies directly by the state authorities without the detour through Europe.,It would be preferable if national governments channelled this money directly to their local governments without a European detour.
"Wir müssen in den nächsten Jahren darüber nachdenken, wie die Strukturfonds durch einen Ausgleichsfonds ersetzt werden können, der sich auf Haushaltsbeihilfen für Mitgliedstaaten oder deren Bundesländer mit niedrigem Pro-Kopf-Einkommen der Bevölkerung beschränkt.",We need to think about how the structural funds will be replaced by an adjustment fund that is limited to household assistance for member states or their federal states with low per capita income to the population.,"We must think in the next years about how the structural funds can be replaced by a balancing fund, which is limited to household assistance for member states or their states with low population per capita income.",We will have to think in the coming years how the structural funds can be replaced by a compensatory fund which is limited to budgetary aids for member states or their federal states with low per capita income of the population.,"In the next couple of years, we will need to think about the possibility of replacing structural funds by an equalisation fund which is limited to budgetary aid for Member States or their constituent regions with a low income per capita of the population."

"Der erste Bericht wurde an die breite Öffentlichkeit gebracht, es wurde ernstlich darüber diskutiert, und wie die ihm vorausgegangenen Auseinandersetzungen und Indiskretionen wurde er dazu benutzt, in erster Linie den Kommissionspräsidenten und sodann die Mehrheit der Mitglieder der Europäischen Kommission ""niederzumachen "", selbst wenn sie mit Betrügereien, Mißwirtschaft und Günstlingswirtschaft nichts zu tun hatten.","The first report was made public to the general public, it was seriously discussed, and how the previous discussions and the indiscernibility of the individuals involved in the matter were used to finally address the Commission President and then the majority of the members of","The first report was brought to the public, serious discussion was held about it, and how the preceding conflicts and indiscretions were used to primarily target the Commission President and then the majority of the Commission's members ""to humiliate"", even if they","The first report was brought to the broad public, it was seriously discussed, and as the preceding disputes and indiscretions it was used to mainly ""knock down"" the Commission President and then the majority of the members of the European Commission, even","The first report was widely publicised, formally debated and used - just like the controversy and news leaks which preceded it - to make mincemeat, first of the President of the Commission, and then of the majority of the European Commissioners, even though they had no connection with fraud, mismanagement or nepotism."
"Wenn wir heute über die Vorgänge vor weniger als einem Jahr lesen, so besteht wohl kein Zweifel daran, daß es bei dem ersten Bericht um alles andere als um die Wahrheitsfindung bzw. um Reformen ging, wie heute behauptet wird, denn der jetzige zweite Bericht, der eigentlich wesentlich aussagekräftiger hätte sein können, wurde mit der ausdrücklichen Anweisung in Auftrag gegeben, keine spezifischen Fälle zu behandeln, da kein Interesse daran bestehe, die in diesem Bericht enthaltenen unerlaubten Handlungen zu verfolgen.","When we read today about the actions taken a little less than a year ago, it is clear that at the first report there was nothing to do with finding the truth or reforming, as is said today, because the second report, which was intended","If we read today about the events of the past year or less, it is likely that there is no doubt that the first report was not about the discovery of truth or reform, as it is claimed today, because the current second report, which would","If we read today about the events of less than a year ago, there is probably no doubt that the first report was about everything other than finding the truth and / or reform, as is claimed today, because the current second report, which could have","Reading now what happened then, not even a year ago, it becomes clear that that first report was intended to do anything but serve the cause of truth or reform, as is maintained today, so much so that this second report - which, on the other hand, could have provided much more salient points - was commissioned with the precise mandate not to address specific cases, since there is no intention to follow up the offences detailed in this report."
"Daran sind weder die großen Fraktionen dieses Parlaments noch ein Großteil der Gewerkschaften interessiert, die den europäischen öffentlichen Dienst zwar verbal verteidigen, aber de facto mit dem berufsständischen Schutz ihrer Mitglieder beschäftigt sind und dazu von den ihnen eingeräumten weitreichenden Befugnissen in fragwürdiger Weise Gebrauch machen.","Those in charge of this parliament are neither the major factions of this parliament nor a large part of the trade unions which verbally defend the public service, but de facto are occupied with the professional protection of their members and use the rights granted to them in dubious","None

"Gewerkschaftsvertreter gehören unbegreiflicherweise auch den Prüfungsausschüssen für die Auswahlverfahren an, und es würde mich nicht wundern, wenn Gewerkschaftsmitglieder bereits im OLAF vertreten wären und diese Institution, die, zumindest formal, Gewähr dafür bieten sollte, super partes zu stehen, damit schwer beeinträchtigen würden.","Workers' representatives belong to an infinite number of committees for the selection procedures, and it would not be surprising if trade union members already were represented in OLAF and this institution, which, at least formally, provides for super partes to stand, would not","Here is the translation:

"Es ist mir also klar, weshalb wir zu dieser Stunde zusammenkommen, die gewöhnlich für andere Tätigkeiten bestimmt ist und nicht dafür, eine Aussprache sowie einen Meinungs- und Informationsaustausch zu führen.","It is clear, therefore, why we are coming at this hour, usually for other tasks, and not for pronunciation or a discussion and exchange of views.","It is therefore clear to me why we are meeting at this hour, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for a discussion, as well as an exchange of opinions and information.","It is therefore clear to me why we gather at this hour, which is normally designated for other activities and not for an exchange of views and an exchange of opinions and information.","I therefore understand why we are meeting at this time, which is usually set aside for other activities and not for debates, discussions and the exchange of information."

"Nach unseren Vorstellungen greifen künftig drei Mechanismen ineinander, die unabhängige Vorabkontrolle durch den Finanzkontrolleur, die begleitende und nachgängige Kontrolle durch den neu zu schaffenden internen Prüfdienst, auch Audit-Dienst genannt, und schließlich durch das gezielte Aufspüren von Unregelmäßigkeiten durch das neue Betrugsbekämpfungsamt OLAF.","After our proposals, three mechanisms will be used in conjunction, the independent control of the financial controller, the accompanying and successive control of the new internal auditor, also the audit department, and finally the targeted detection of irregularities by the new fraud prevention agency","According to our ideas, three mechanisms will come into play, which include independent pre-control by the Financial Control Authority, accompanying and ongoing control by the new internal audit service, also known as Audit Service, and finally, the targeted detection of irregularities by","According to our vision, three mechanisms will be interlinked in the future: independent pre-control by the financial controller, accompanying and subsequent control by the newly created internal audit service, also called the audit service, and finally, targeted detection of irregularities by","As we see it, there will be a dovetailing of three mechanisms in the future: a system of independent prior approval by the financial controller, concomitant and follow-up control by the internal audit service - also known as the audit service - which has yet to be set up, and finally, there will be the targeted tracking-down of irregularities by OLAF, the new anti-fraud office."

Aufgrund des beträchtlichen Umfangs der kurzfristigen Kapitalbewegungen wäre selbst bei einer sehr niedrigen nominalen Tobin-Steuer das Steueraufkommen erheblich.,"Because of the considerable scope of the short-term capital movements, even at a very low nominal Tobin tax would be a substantial tax revenue.","Due to the substantial volume of short-term capital movements, even at a very low nominal Tobin tax would result in a substantial tax revenue.","Due to the considerable volume of short-term capital movements, even with a very low nominal Tobin tax, the tax revenue would be significant.","Taking into account the considerable volume of short-term financial streams, even a low nominal Tobin tax would yield respectable sums of tax revenue."
"Dem wachsenden Interesse an der Tobin-Steuer und an anderen internationalen Finanzquellen Mitte der 90er Jahre lagen in Wirklichkeit nichtwirtschaftliche Motive zugrunde, nämlich die durch diese Steuer zu erzielenden Einnahmen zur Finanzierung internationaler öffentlicher Programme in einer Zeit, in der die Nachfrage nach solchen Finanzierungsmitteln rasch zunahm und Kapital immer schwieriger zu beschaffen war.","Dem wachsenden Interesse an der Tobin-Steuer und an anderen internationalen Finanzquellen Mitte der 90er Jahre lagen in Wirklichkeit nichtwirtschaftliche Motive zugrunde, nämlich die","The growing interest in the Tobin tax and other international financial sources in the mid-1990s actually had non-economic motivations underlying it, namely the revenue generated by this tax for financing international public programs in a time when demand for such funding was rapidly","The growing interest in the Tobin tax and other international financial sources in the mid-1990s was motivated by non-economic reasons, namely the revenue generated by the tax to finance international public programs at a time when the demand for such financing was rapidly","In reality, the motive underlying the increased interest in the Tobin tax and other sources of international finance in the mid-nineties was non-economic.

"Die Kommission hat vor kurzem ein erneutes Interesse an einer weltweiten Steuer wie der Tobin-Steuer festgestellt, die dazu dienen soll, zu einer sozusagen sozialverträglichen Globalisierung zu gelangen.","The commission has recently asserted its interest in another global tax such as the Tobin tax, which is intended to achieve a so-called socially responsible globalization.","The commission recently re-established interest in a global tax like the Tobin tax, intended to lead to a kind of socially acceptable globalisation.","The Commission has recently indicated renewed interest in a global tax like the Tobin tax, which is intended to lead to a so-called socially acceptable globalization.","The Commission recently observed renewed interest in a global tax, such as the Tobin tax, as a means of achieving socially responsible globalisation, so to speak."
